"""
tg-relay-tts sidecar — voice synthesis HTTP server.

Runs as a persistent local service. The tg-relay daemon POSTs text here when
Claude chooses to reply by voice, and Pulse (~/.pulse/config.json) posts to the
same endpoint. Returns synthesized WAV bytes for the caller to wrap however it
likes (the daemon turns them into an ogg/opus Telegram voice note).

Two engines are supported, selected by TG_RELAY_TTS_ENGINE:

  chatterbox (default)  Resemble AI's Chatterbox Turbo — 350M params, English,
                        MIT. Clones zero-shot from ~10s of reference audio and
                        needs NO transcript. Supports emotion control and
                        paralinguistic tags ([laugh], [sigh], [chuckle]) inline
                        in the text.
  f5                    The original F5-TTS v1 Base path, kept as a rollback.

The two engines pin incompatible torch versions (chatterbox wants 2.6.0, the
F5 install is on 2.13.0+cu130), so they live in SEPARATE virtualenvs —
.venv-chatterbox and .venv respectively — and the systemd unit picks the
interpreter that matches the engine. Nothing here imports both.

Reference audio is resolved per-channel:
  1. ~/.claude/channels/telegram-<name>/reference.wav
  2. ~/.cache/tg-relay-tts/reference.wav (global fallback)
  3. None → HTTP 404, caller falls back to text

F5 additionally requires reference.txt (an exact transcript) alongside the wav;
Chatterbox does not, so a channel that has only a wav works on chatterbox and
404s on f5. That asymmetry is deliberate and is the main reason to prefer
chatterbox: adding a voice is now one file, not two.

Memory: the model loads LAZILY on the first synth, and the heavy torch imports
are deferred with it, so the idle baseline stays tens of MB rather than
gigabytes. A burst of replies reuses the warm model; after
TG_RELAY_TTS_IDLE_SECS of idle the process exits and the service manager
(systemd Restart=always / launchd KeepAlive) relaunches it fresh, releasing the
model AND torch's resident import — a plain `del` cannot reclaim the latter
in-process. First synth after idle pays the cold load; callers' timeouts cover it.
